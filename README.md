###This project builds a complete machine learning ETL pipeline powered by MLflow to classify whether a given website is spam or not spam. The system automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data, followed by training a machine learning model to achieve high accuracy in detecting fraudulent or suspicious websites.Goal: Build a scalable and reproducible pipeline to continuously train, track, and improve spam detection models, while ensuring robust data handling from ingestion to model deployment
### this is  my network security project for phising data
